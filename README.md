This project FE built on NextJS 15, similar to React. Hard parts will be covered by me (FE only).

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

# Before commit:
```git checkout <your branch>
git add .
git commit -m "<commit message>"
git push
```
This will create a pull request.

Then go to this repo, go to ```Pull requests``` and create a Pull request, check all the merge conflicts (if there is) and resolve. Then "Merge".

If you unsure about the conflict resolves if there is any, tell me to review to prevent any damage to the source code.
